# 🐍 Snake Agent

Welcome to my **Snake Agent** project! This project explores how a neural network can learn to play the classic game of **Snake**, with the end goal of implementing both a **software-based AI agent** and a **hardware-based FPGA implementation**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn how to play Snake using reinforcement learning in Python.
- Visualize the learning process and game performance over time.
- Translate the trained neural network into a **hardware-friendly format** and implement it in **Verilog** on an FPGA (e.g., Basys3).
- Build a **fully autonomous Snake-playing system** that runs independently on FPGA hardware.
